# Contributing to SHOUTOUT

### How to contribute

1. [Fork the project](https://github.com/kayisire/shoutout) and clone it to your local machine. Follow the README file.
2. Create a branch with the `FEATURE` as a prefix and `ACTION` as a suffix. <br />
For example: <br />
`git checkout -b thatNewFeature_bugFix` or <br />
`git checkout -b anotherFeature_creation` <br />
where `FEATURE` should be replaced by a feature you are working on and `ACTION` is what you implemented.
3. Code and commit your changes. Follow the `README.md` file for commit messages example.
4. Push to the branch you created.
5. Create a pull request to the `staging` branch. ðŸŽ‰
